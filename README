hw3: 3D objects

Kelley Kelley
CSCI 5229 Fall 2021

So, I made a ground for everything to go on.
It's a quad.
I made some grass.
They are randomly places quads and triangles.
Made a nice picket fence.
It's a lot of rectangles.
Then, I was done with decorations and wanted to have trees.
Except I wanted the trees to be random.
This usually wouldn't be that complicated
but everytime glut calls display it would
randomize everything again. Which means the trees
are a very excessive hash-psuedo-random that
remains consistent across redisplays.
But you can still randomize them all with space.
Also means you could add animation to this 
(technically the grass is animated and wiggles)
and the trees will remain the same.
I also added black lines around all the edges of
everything because otherwise no lighting looks dumb.
If you think the trees are ugly and I did a bad job,
hit space until they all look good :P
(It's hard to make trees randomly look good)

Time Spent: 14 hours
Key Bindings:
Arrow keys: move display around
Pageup/Pagedwn: zoom in/out
Space: rerandomize everything
